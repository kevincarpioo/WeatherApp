Weather App

Description
Yet another weather app to tell you it's raining when you can literally look out your window! But seriously, this is a simple web application that lets you check the weather for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API. For those times when blinds are just too heavy to lift.

Technologies Used
Flask (because we needed another Python web framework)
SQLAlchemy (because raw SQL is so 1999)
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (the holy trinity of web development)
Bootstrap (making developers feel like designers since 2011)

How to Use
Type in a city name (yes, it needs to be a real one)
Hit that "Submit" button (the suspense is killing me!)
Marvel at the current weather display (spoiler alert: it's probably cloudy)

Note: Despite the lighthearted tone, this is actually a fully functional weather application. No meteorologists were harmed in the making of this README.
